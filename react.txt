    what npm ?
    assume you make directory and you want to use npm to make the use eay
    such as download some packages as bootstrap and jquery just you npm start 
    all dependency will attach to your folder.

just you see src in any project you must know that your code will write here.

inside render you can type html code and will appear يعني اللي موجود داخله هو اللي هيكون موجود في الصفحة
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>);
JSK it mean that we write javascript and html 
any dynamic variable write with {}
